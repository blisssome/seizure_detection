## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a robust system capable of detecting epileptic seizures from neurological data. Utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, the system processes input data to identify patterns indicative of seizure activity.

## Features

- **Data Handling**: Efficient loading and preprocessing of neurological datasets.
- **Model Management**: Modular architecture for training and evaluating various machine learning models.
- **Checkpointing**: Save and load model states to facilitate training resumption and deployment.
- **Utilities**: Helper functions to support data manipulation and model operations.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/blisssome/seizure_detection.git
   cd seizure_detection
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Configure the project**:

   Modify the `config.py` file to set parameters such as data paths, model configurations, and training hyperparameters.

2. **Prepare the dataset**:

   Ensure your dataset is structured appropriately and update the paths in `config.py` accordingly.

3. **Run the training script**:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will initiate the training process based on the configurations provided.
